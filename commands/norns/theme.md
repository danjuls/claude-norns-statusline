Switch the claude-norns-statusline theme to: $ARGUMENTS

Available themes: yggdrasil, bifrost, ragnarok, valhalla, mist, jotunheim

Instructions:
1. Read the config file at `~/.config/claude-norns-statusline/config.json` (if it exists)
2. If the file or directory doesn't exist, create it with `{ "theme": "<chosen-theme>" }`
3. If it exists, update only the `"theme"` key and preserve all other settings
4. Write the updated JSON back (pretty-printed with 2-space indent)
5. Confirm the change briefly, e.g. "Switched theme to bifrost"

The change takes effect immediately on the next statusline refresh (no restart needed).

If the theme name is not in the available list, show the available options and ask which one to use.
